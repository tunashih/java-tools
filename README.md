This utility tool automates the process of searching files in a specific directory for a given keyword in a certain timeframe, then copies the matched ones into another folder.

The user interface provides an easy way for users to input desired information and shows a progress bar and a button to cancel the action.

To avoid entering the same input over and over again for future searches, this tool also offers a feature to save current configurations, which can be loaded later on.
